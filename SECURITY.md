# Security Policy

At [RaBe](https://rabe.ch/) we strive to run our IT in a modern and secure fashion.

We kindly ask that any security issues are disclosed in a responsible manner so we
can address them in a coordinated manner.

Some of our GitHub repositories have enabled private reporting of issues via the
security tab in GitHub. You may also repo any security issues to our internal,
semi-public, Email it@rabe.ch. 

Same as our radio station, the RaBe IT deparment is volunteer run. Please keep
this in mind when expecting a fast turnaround on security issues. In urgent, 
and/or sensitive cases you may also [reach out to our staff directly](https://rabe.ch/kontaktadressen/).
