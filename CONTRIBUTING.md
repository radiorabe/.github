# Contributing to RaBe

Hi! Thanks for wanting to contribute to RaBe's Free and Open Source Software.

RaBe is a volunter run community radio station broadcasting throughout the
larger Bern area. Our mission includes providing equitable access to broadcast
to our local community and we also publish most of our code for inspection
and external use.

## Every Contribution is Welcome

Be it writing issues, giving feedback, and contributing code are all appreciated.

Feel free to reach out via GitHub issues, discussions or via our it@rabe.ch Email
if you have any questions on how to get started.

## IT Reaktion

The RaBe IT Reaktion meets regularly at the RaBe Studios. Please reach out if
would like to talk to us about a larger contribution or you are in the area and
would like to get to know us in person.

## Gettng on the air.
